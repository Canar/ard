ideological versions
the reference desktop
	a specifically-configured alternate distribution, initially debian
the minimal ideal
	minimal core
		sinit->get event services
	self-healing core
		double+ redundancy
		git repository of source code
	
	binary packages (lrzip)
	local-built kernel and packages
	shipped as a binary that fetches source to regenerate
	contains no shell scripts
transitional material
	compatibility shims
	weight-loss scripts

lrzip might permit insane compression on static-linked compiles!

install process:
	1. fetch and install
		download fewest packages as necessary to permit reboot to functional network state
	2. reboot, finish package fetch, install
	3. reboot, fetch sources, build, install
	4. 

an implicit ideological statement of systemd is that processes are expected to be supervised
