The word for a sentence of words is a sentence. 



Verbs cause. 

A word is a symbol. 

A word is to a symbol what a sentence is to a word. 
A word may be a sentence. 
A symbol may be a word.

All words are symbols. All groups of words are usually 

I. Be. (I am.) 

All valid sentences begin with a capital letter.

The term for a list of terms is the list. (This is just a comment, freestyle and unparsed. (Comments can be nested.) A literate, approachable programming style must contain comments. The more natural the language, the better.)

The term for a list of lists is the list. (A traditional approach to computing sees everything as one long string of bits. Theoretically, a tree can be traversed in different ways to yield multiple correct sequences, but only a finite number of actual solutions.)

The term for a list with one term is term. (This is critical, there is no difference between a term and a list. A list is merely a term defined by its contents. A term's contents have a type. There are two basic types: terms and lists. Terms may be verbs. Verbs document a cause and effect relationship. Terms may be nouns. Nouns are types. Nouns are objects. Terms are nouns. Verbs are terms. Verbs are nouns. To define a noun by the same verb is to define an object by its default action. The default action is "get". The language succeeded by this manifesto is called "get event".)

The term the precedes the type in defining the object. The type specifies the object. The object has the type object. The object is defined as the term that precedes the type. The object may be specified by the type.

The term term is defined as 

The object is defined as itself. The term "is defined as itself" is defined as itself.

The bitstream is defined as a definite sequence of at least a finite number of bits.

A=term
B=noun

The A for a B of As is a B.
The A for a B of Bs is a B.
The A for a B with one A is an A.
A number of As is a B.

Code is just a data type with unusual properties.
State is data. 
Good code represents the largest possible state space in the smallest possible data space.
	- compilation is both inevitable and ignorable
Every program has a single point of origin. If multiple producers work together, all are treated as equal by default.

!1 - producer variable 1
	- might be static or dynamic
		- static returns same result always
		- dynamic behaves as a stream
		- semi-dynamic - change is infrequent
			- change can be quantified and optimized for.
@1 - consumer variable 1
	- transports data away; is the receiver for state that is calculated but no longer useful
		- optimized system has no wasted space; extra space is used for precalculation
			- in non-compiled form, most common operations must be single characters
			- most common
	- @1 is roughly stdin, @2 roughly stderr... ? or are they? one channel of log with multiple channels of data. the log is singular, one in many

In a programming context, objects are represented as nouns. Functions and methods are represented as verbs. A method is simply a function that is bound to a particular noun. Programs are verbs. Programs are lists of verbs. Programs are lists of words. Programs are lists of nouns. A word can be a noun or a verb or both. Term is a noun and a verb. Term is that which is described, a word. Term is the action of describing something. 

#A ball is a round object that is thrown.

A definition defines a list.
A number of definitions defines a list.
A number of definitions defines a definition.
A list containing one definition defines a definition.
All lists are definitions. 
Not all definitions are lists. 
A definition that is not a list is an atom.

It takes a lot to dislodge a system that can recompose itself to adapt to new threats.
Hide in "free" disk space. Redundant / diverse system. Multiple independent implementations of the same thing. Like the teleporter gate tech exploit in that onebook. Multiple implementations test themselves. wget x curl x web. OS is a database of implementations.

There are worlds that exist that we cannot even imagine.

Primary lash punctuation involves the space, more generally the white space, 

Prolog backtracks from failed predicates, but behaves in a depth-first approach. There are logical cases where a breath-first approach is preferable.
